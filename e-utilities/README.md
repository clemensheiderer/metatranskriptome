the NCBI provides a direct interface to their databases, which is called "e-utilities".
 They are available as command line tools and as libraries for scripting languages, such as Python and Perl. 
 Solve a database related exercise question by using the e-utilities: download the genome record of Escherichia coli K-12 
 by using the e-utilities. Download the record in GenBank and FASTA formats and determine the number of genomic elements,
 their sizes and their numbers of predicted genes. Your solutions can be submitted at any time here.
